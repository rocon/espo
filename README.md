# Espo

An Extension and Dialect of Esperanto

===

There have been a number of proposed reforms of [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) since its inception, which deal with its perceived deficiencies. But the language itself is fine as a springboard language, and only needs a few additions, not a replacement of any kind. Therefore just as Zamenhof summarized the grammar of Esperanto in just 16 rules, I propose just 16 new items (and one orthographay item) that add some grammar but do not replace or modify any existing word in its current vocabulary. When these words are used they deprecate the usage of existing words in the sense that these are the preferred words, but this is not the same as saying those existing words cannot not be used anymore. Some of these proposals have been influenced by current tendencies in Esperanto like Riism. These changes also align Espo better with the features of [Standard Average European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Average_European) (features characteristic of European languages), so it should feel even more natural to speakers of European languages.

Note: the name **Espo** is not a replacement of the name **Esperanto**: what it names is the particular usage of Esperanto in conjunction with any of the 16 items in the list shown below.

0. *Input method*

Next to traditional method of appending an *-h*, or the method which PIV employs (appending *-x*), the preferred input method for Espo is to use all four unused letters (q, x, w, y), as follows:

*sx --> ŝ*

*cx --> ĉ*

*jy --> ĵ*

*gy --> ĝ*

*qh --> ĥ*

*uw --> ŭ*

The input method for the middle·dot is a dot: *prefixed.word*.

1. *Articles*

Unlike Esperanto, Espo uses the indefinite article *un* in front of a noun: *un domo* (a house).

2. *Nouns*

Esperanto mandates the use of the accusative *-n* case marking on all nouns. Since in common practice the word order is always Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), the case marking is only necessary when the Object is moved to a position before the Subject, or if the Subject is missing: *mi amas vi*; *vin mi amas*, *dankon*.

3. *Adjectives*

Adjectives that modify the noun do not take the plural *-j-* or accusive *-n* ending. This is only necessary if the adjective functions as a noun (if it does not modify a noun): *la bruna hundoj*; *la brunaj*.

4. *Affixes*

The prefix *no-* is used instead of *mal-* to express opposities: *nolonga* (short).

The word *iĉo* is used as the suffix *-iĉ-*, which turns an epicene noun, or a masculine noun from which the feminine noun is derived, into a masculine-only noun, e.g., *filiĉo* (son) - compare with *filino* (daughter). This deprecates the usage of *viro* in the form of the *vir* prefix, and so is the usage of masculine root nouns that are also used as the root from the feminine noun is derived.

Even though the prefix *ge-*, derived from the word *geo*, is not new, what is new is its usage in the singular instead of the plural. A word like *amiko* (man friend) should not be used as the root noun anymore, but to express the concept of a gender-indifferent friend we use it with the prefix *ge-* as in *geamiko* (friend - whether man of woman), and of course the existing usage in the plural (*geamikoj*) is still supported.

5. *Prepositions*

To express a certain time, use te *su* preposition: *su lundo*  - on Monday.
To express motion into an object, use the  *dan* preposition: *al·en la domo --> dan la domo* (into the house).

The preposition *de* is overloaded in meaning in Esperanto: it should only be used in the meaning of the preposition 'of' in English. To express the movement from a location (commonly expressed as 'from' in English) the preposition *di* should be used. To express the starting time of an event (commonly expressed as 'since' in English) the preposition *ekde* should be used. To express the agent of something (commonly expressed as 'by'in English) the preposition *far* should be used. Example: *la libro (verkita) far la aŭtoro di la urbo ekde un jaro* (the book (written) by the author from the city since a year).

The accusative case can alternatively be expressed with the *na* preposition, the plural of a noun with the *jo* preposition. They can also be combined: *na jo*.

6. *Pronouns*

Esperanto has no gender-indifferent third-personal singular pronoun, a feature which many languages have. I propose to use the word *ri* (he/she) in case where this is needed or desired. This does not deprecate the usage of the existing words *ŝi* (she) and *li* (he), which are perfectly usable to refer to one person of specific gender.

Impersonal verbs are expressed wit the *ti ...* verb construction: *ti pluvas* - it rains.

7. *Verbs*

Verb roots in Esperanto are either transitive or intransivite, but unlike the noun category no distinction is made in the verb ending between the two. In Espo intransitive verbs end in *-i*, like in Esperanto, and transitive verbs end in *-ir*, with an added -r. Both endings are only present in the infinitive, and dropped when the verb is conjugated. Note that some verbs can be used both ways: *danci(r)*. Examples: *iri* - to go, *legir* - to read.

The verb *esti/estas* covers both the existential usage (to be located somewhere), the predicative usage (to be something) and the passive usage (to be done something to). I propose splitting this verb up in two verbs: the verb *esti/estas* keeps being used for the existential usage, the verb *sti/stas* (with the e- dropped out) as a new auxiliary verb for the predicative and passive usage. The past tense (*stis*) and imperative (*stu*) follow the established patterns. Examples: *mi estas en la urbo* (I am home), *ĝi stas un domo* (it is a house).

The usage of the verb to have (like *havi/havas*) as an auxiliary verb + generic passive participle to express the perfect tense is very widespread amongst Western-European languages. It is easier to understand and use than the corresponding Esperanto grammatical usage of the conjugated verb to be (*esti/estas*) + a tense-carrying active participle which is also an adjective. My proposal is to introduce a new verb *hi/has/his* (with the -av- dropped out) in combination with a generic passive participle ending in *-it* (with the -n- and the -a dropped out) , irrespective of the transitivity of the verb. Idem dito for *sti*: *stit*. Examples: *mi has dormit* (I have slept) - compare with *mi estas dorminta* in the intransitive, and *mi has legit la libro* (I have read the book) - compare with *mi estas leginta la libro* in the transitive.

The future and pas future tenses are expressed wit the auxiliary *sti* verb: *stos/stus* plus the infinitive of the actual verb (and not as *-os/-us* declensions on the same verb). Examples: *mi stos legi* - I will read, *mi stus legi* - I would read.

The near (past) future, usually expressed in English with the word *about*, is expressed in Espo with the auxiliary *vas/vis* verbs. Examples: *mi vas legi* - I am about to read, *mi vis legi* - I was about about to read,

Existential verbs are expressed wit the *der ...* verb construction: *der estas un domo* - there is a house.

8. *Adverbs*

In Esperanto direction on adverbs is expressed with the *-n* ending. In Espo this is replaced with the *je* preposition: *mi iras je hejme*  - I go home.

9. *Correlatives*

The relative correlatives (*kvi-*) are distinct from the interrogative correlatives (*ki-*).

10. *Possessive*

The possessive 's construction in English can be expressed with the *zi* preposition: *la knabo zi jako* (the boy's jacket).

11. *Compound Words*

In Esperanto compound nouns two or more nouns are joined together, and in case it does not result in a hard-to-pronounce consonant cluster, the -o ending in between the nouns is dropped. However, this results in words having to be mentally 'parsed' for potential boundaries between the first and the second noun, which is not immediately obvious because of the missing -o ending, and because of the fact that nouns (unlike prepositions and prefixes) are an open-ended word category.

In Espo compound words when two or more words are joined together, and in case the ending of the first word (like -o) is not dropped, then the words should always be separated by an apostrophe (the same goes for correlatives), because the ending is a conjugation which only belongs with the first word. When the -o is dropped (when the word ends in a vowel or only one consonant, except for -h), the words are separated with a hyphen. This is not necessary for the unconjugated, closed category word classes like prepositions, numerals, prefixes and suffixes, which get the middle·dot (Unicode character U+00B7). Examples: *dento'broso* (toothbrush), *ĉiu'taga* (everyday), *vel-ŝipo (sailing vessel)* - *kant-birdo (song bird)*, *al·veni* (to arrive), *dek·un* (eleven).

12. *New words*
 
The word *geamiko* also has a special shortened version: *miko*.

The word *virino* already means woman, and now we also have the word *viriĉo* for man, but the words for man and woman are basic words in nearly every language that they deserve their own separate word. I propose the word *femo* for woman, and to keep the word *viro* for man. To keep using the word *viro* in this way is then not an exception to the rule that masculine base nouns from which feminine nouns are derived have been deprecated, since we do not use those two masculine and feminine derived words anymore.

Nearly every language in the world has very concrete words for father and mother, and these words are used to such an extant that they too deserve separate lexical entries. The existing word for father is *patro*, to which we add the word *mutro* for mother. The derivations *patriĉo* and *patrino* are therfore not used. Since we have a new word for mother (*mutro*), and we already have a word for daddy (*paĉjo*) we should also have a new word for mommy: *munjo*.

The verb *farti* sounds really awkward in English. Since English is such a prevalent language, the most widely-spoken second language in the world, I propose to replace it with the verb *ferti* (influenced by English to fare - pronounced as /fer/).

The noun *homo* has a well-established meaning in many languages, therefore I propose to replace it with the noun *huomo* (influenced by Italian uomo).

The interjection words *hej* and *nej* are used instead of *he* and *ne*.

13. *Direction*

Movement to an object is expressed with the *al* preposition (not with the accusitave *-n* case): *la kato saltis al·sur la tablo* - the cat jumped onto the table.

14. *Foreign names*

Espo prefers foreign names (personal and geographical) to be retained in their (Romanized) native spelling, so as much as possible without diacritics.
For geographical names of like continents and oceans, which are not limited to the language of one country, generalized Esp(erant)o-specific names can still be used. Examples: *Nord-Ameriko, Sud-Ameriko, Atlantiko, Arktiko, Eŭropo, Afriko, Antarktiko, Azio, Indioceano, Australio, Oceanio, Pacifiko*.

15. *Sentences*

Sentences do not need to start with a Capitalized letter and end in a full stop (*.*): the capitalization of the first letter is optional, and two sentences can then be separated with a semicolon (*;*).

16. *Schwa insertion*

Words with unusual consonant combinations can be pronounced by inserting a schwa in between two such consonants. Example: *ftizo - /fə'tizo̞/*.
