There have been a number of proposed reforms of Esperanto since its inception, which deal with its perceived deficiencies. But the language itself is fine, and only needs a few additions, not a replacement of any kind. Therefore just as Zamenhof summarized the grammar of Esperanto in just 16 rules, I propose just 14 new items that do not replace or modify any existing word in its current vocabulary. When these words are used they deprecate the usage of existing words in the sense that these are the preferred words, but this is not the same as saying those existing words cannot not be used anymore. Some of these proposals have been influenced by Riism.

1. *Espo*

The name **Espo** is not a replacement of the name **Esperanto**: what it names is the particular usage of Esperanto in conjunction with any of the 14 items in this list.

2. *middle·dot*

In compound nouns two or more nouns are joined together, and in case it does not result in a hard-to-pronounce consonant cluster, the -o ending in between the nouns is dropped. However, this results in words having to be mentally 'parsed' for potential boundaries between the first and the second noun, which is not immediately obvious because of the missing -o ending, and because of the fact that nouns (unlike prepositions and prefixes) are an open-ended word category. The middle dot (Unicode character U+00B7), unlike the hyphen (-) which is sometimes used in Esperanto for the same purpose, is an unobtrusive way to give the needed visual distinction with such compound nouns. Examples: *vel·ŝipo (sailing vessel)* - *kant·birdo (song bird)*.

3. *-i'*

Verb roots in Esperanto are either transitive or intransivite, but unlike the noun category no distinction is made in the verb ending between the two. In Espo transitive verbs end in *-i*, like in Esperanto, and intransitive verbs end in *-i'*, with an added apostrophe ('). It indicates the missing *-j* semivowel (e.g. *bolij* - to boil), which was still present in Archaic Proto-Esperanto for the intransitive verb category to distinguish them from the transitive verb category. Both endings are pronounced /i/ and only present in the infinitive, dropped when the verb is conjugated. Example: *boli'* - to boil.

4. *iĉo/-iĉ-*

The word *iĉo* is used as the suffix *-iĉ-*, which turns an epicene noun, or a masculine noun from which the feminine noun is derived, into a masculine-only noun, e.g., *filiĉo* (son) - compare with *filino* (daughter). This deprecates the usage if *viro* in the form of the *vir* prefix, and so is the usage of masculine root nouns that are also used as the root from the feminine noun is derived.

5. *geo/ge-.-o*

Even though the prefix *ge-*, derived from the word *geo*, is not new, what is new is its usage in the singular instead of the plural. A word like *amiko* (man friend) should not be usd as the root noun anymore, but to express the concept of a gender-indifferent friend we use it with the prefix *ge-* as in *geamiko* (frriend - whether man of woman), and of course the existing usage in the plural (*geamikoj*) is still supported.

6. *muliero*

The word *virino* already means woman, and now we also have the word *viriĉo* for man, but the words for man and woman are basic words in nearly every language that they deserve their own separate word. I propose the word *muliero* for woman, and to keep the word *viro* for man (both these words are derived from Latin). To keep using the word *viro* in this way is then not an exception to the rule that masculine base nouns from which feminine nouns are derived have been deprecated, since we do not use those two masculine and feminine derived words anymore.

7. *matro*

Nearly every language in the world has very concrete words for father and mother, and these words are used to such an extant that they too deserve separate lexical entries. The existing word for father is *patro*, to which we add the word *matro* for mother (both words are dervied from LAtin). The derivatiojns *patriĉo* and *patrino* are therfore not used.

8. *manjo*

Since we have a new word for mother (*matro*), and we already have a word for daddy (*paĉjo*) we should also have a new word for mommy: *manjo*, which brings to mind the French equivalent maman.

9. *ri* 

Esperanto has no gender-indifferent third-personal singular pronoun, a feature which many languages have. I propose to use the word *ri* (he/she) in case where this is needed or desired. This does not deprecate the usage of the existing words *ŝi* (she) and *li* (he), which are perfectly usable to refer to one person of specific gender.

10. *zi*

The word the gender-indifferent third-person plural pronoun in Esperanto (*ili* - they) sounds a lot like the word for the gender-specific male pronoun (*li*). I propose to use the word *zi* instead (influenced by German Sie).

11. *sti/stas*

The verb *esti/estas* covers both the existential usage (to be located somewhere) and the predicative usage (to be something). I propose splitting this verb up in two verbs: the verb *esti/estas* keeps being used for the existential usage, the verb *sti/stas* (with the e- dropped out) for the predicative usage. Examples: *mi estas en la domo* (I am home), *ĝi stas domo* (it is a house).

12. *hi/has + -it*

The usage of the verb to have (like *havi/havas*) as an auxiliary verb + generic passive participle to express the perfect tense is very widespread amongst Western-European languages. It is easier to understand and use than the corresponding Esperanto grammatical usage of the conjugated verb to be (*esti/estas*) + a tense-carrying active participle which is also an adjective. My proposal is to introduce a new verb *hi/has* (with the -av- dropped out) in combination with a generic passive participle (with the -n- and -a dropped out). Examples: *mi has dormit* - compare with *mi estas dorminta*.

13. *ferti*

The verb *farti* sounds really awkward in English. Since English is such a prevalent language, the most widely-spoken second language in the world, I propose to replace it with the verb *ferti* (influenced by English to fare - pronounced as /fer/).

14. *huomo*

The noun *homo* has a well-established meaning in many languages, therefore I propose to replace it with the noun *huomo* (influenced by Italian uomo).
