# Espo

An Extension and Dialect of Esperanto

===

There have been a number of proposed reforms of [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) since its inception, which deal with its perceived deficiencies. But the language itself is fine as a springboard language, and only needs a few additions, not a replacement of any kind. Therefore just as Zamenhof summarized the grammar of Esperanto in just 16 rules, I propose just 16 new items that do not replace or modify any existing word in its current vocabulary. When these words are used they deprecate the usage of existing words in the sense that these are the preferred words, but this is not the same as saying those existing words cannot not be used anymore. Some of these proposals have been influenced by current tendencies in Esperanto like Riism. These changes also align Espo better with the features of [Standard Average European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Average_European) (features characteristic of European languages), so it should feel even more natural to speakers of European languages.

Note: the name **Espo** is not a replacement of the name **Esperanto**: what it names is the particular usage of Esperanto in conjunction with any of the 16 items in the list shown below.

1. *Articles*

Unlike Esperanto, Espo uses the indefinite article *un* in front of a noun: *un domo* (a house).

2. *Nouns*

Esperanto mandates the use of the accusative *-n* case marking on all nouns. Since in common practice the word order is always Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), the case marking is only necessary when the Object is moved to a position before the Subject, or if the Subject is missing: *mi amas vi*; *vin mi amas*, *dankon*.

2. *Adjectives*

Adjectives that modify the noun do not take the plural *-j-* or accusive *-n* ending. This is only necessary if the adjective functions as a noun (if it does not modify a noun): *la bruna hundoj*; *la brunaj*.

3. *di/ekde/far*

The preposition *de* is overloaded in meaning in Esperanto: it should only be used in the meaning of the preposition 'of' in English. To express the movement from a location (commonly expressed as 'from' in English) the preposition *di* should be used. To express the starting time of an event (commonly expressed as 'since' in English) the preposition *ekde* should be used. To express the agent of something (commonly expressed as 'by'in English) the preposition *far* should be used. Example: *la libro (verkita) far la aŭtoro di la urbo ekde un jaro* (the book (written) by the author from the city since a year).

4. *separator-hyphen*

In compound words when two or more words are joined together, and in case the ending of the first word (like -o) is not dropped, then the words should always be separated by a hyphen, because the ending is a conjugation which only belongs with the first word. The same goes for correlatives. This is not necessary for the unconjugated, closed category word classes like prepositions, numerals, prefixes and suffixes. Examples: *dento-broso* (toothbrush), *ĉiu-taga* (everyday).

4/5. *compound words*
*'* with 1 consonant
*o-* with 2 more more consonants
*
5. *middle·dot*

In compound nouns two or more nouns are joined together, and in case it does not result in a hard-to-pronounce consonant cluster, the -o ending in between the nouns is dropped. However, this results in words having to be mentally 'parsed' for potential boundaries between the first and the second noun, which is not immediately obvious because of the missing -o ending, and because of the fact that nouns (unlike prepositions and prefixes) are an open-ended word category. The middle dot (Unicode character U+00B7), unlike the hyphen (-) which is sometimes used in Esperanto for the same purpose, is an unobtrusive way to give the needed visual distinction with such compound nouns. Examples: *vel·ŝipo (sailing vessel)* - *kant·birdo (song bird)*.

6a. *no-/mal-*

6. *iĉo/-iĉ-*

The word *iĉo* is used as the suffix *-iĉ-*, which turns an epicene noun, or a masculine noun from which the feminine noun is derived, into a masculine-only noun, e.g., *filiĉo* (son) - compare with *filino* (daughter). This deprecates the usage of *viro* in the form of the *vir* prefix, and so is the usage of masculine root nouns that are also used as the root from the feminine noun is derived.

7. *geo/ge-.-o*

Even though the prefix *ge-*, derived from the word *geo*, is not new, what is new is its usage in the singular instead of the plural. A word like *amiko* (man friend) should not be used as the root noun anymore, but to express the concept of a gender-indifferent friend we use it with the prefix *ge-* as in *geamiko* (friend - whether man of woman), and of course the existing usage in the plural (*geamikoj*) is still supported. The word *geamiko* also has a special shortened version: *miko*.

8. *femo*

The word *virino* already means woman, and now we also have the word *viriĉo* for man, but the words for man and woman are basic words in nearly every language that they deserve their own separate word. I propose the word *gino* (derived from Greek _gyn-_) for woman, and to keep the word *viro* (derived from Latin) for man. To keep using the word *viro* in this way is then not an exception to the rule that masculine base nouns from which feminine nouns are derived have been deprecated, since we do not use those two masculine and feminine derived words anymore.

9a. *getro*
9. *mutro/munjo*

Nearly every language in the world has very concrete words for father and mother, and these words are used to such an extant that they too deserve separate lexical entries. The existing word for father is *patro* (derived from Latin), to which we add the word *mutro* for mother (derived from German _Mutter_). The derivations *patriĉo* and *patrino* are therfore not used. Since we have a new word for mother (*mutro*), and we already have a word for daddy (*paĉjo*) we should also have a new word for mommy: *munjo*.

10. *ri* 

Esperanto has no gender-indifferent third-personal singular pronoun, a feature which many languages have. I propose to use the word *ri* (he/she) in case where this is needed or desired. This does not deprecate the usage of the existing words *ŝi* (she) and *li* (he), which are perfectly usable to refer to one person of specific gender.

11. *zi*

possessive 's

11b. *su*
su lundo -> lundon
11c. *dan*
dan la domo -> al en la domo / en la domon
11d. je + -e
je hejme -> hejmen

12. *-ir*

Verb roots in Esperanto are either transitive or intransivite, but unlike the noun category no distinction is made in the verb ending between the two. In Esperanto intransitive verbs end in *-i*, like in Esperanto, and transitive verbs end in *-ir*, with an added -r. Both endings are only present in the infinitive, and dropped when the verb is conjugated. Example: *legir* - to read.

13. *sti/stas/stis/stu/stit*

The verb *esti/estas* covers both the existential usage (to be located somewhere), the predicative usage (to be something) and the passive usage (to be done something to). I propose splitting this verb up in two verbs: the verb *esti/estas* keeps being used for the existential usage, the verb *sti/stas* (with the e- dropped out) as a new auxiliary verb for the predicative and passive usage. Examples: *mi estas en la domo* (I am home), *ĝi stas un domo* (it is a house).

13B. *stos/stus*

14. *hi/has/hit + -it*

The usage of the verb to have (like *havi/havas*) as an auxiliary verb + generic passive participle to express the perfect tense is very widespread amongst Western-European languages. It is easier to understand and use than the corresponding Esperanto grammatical usage of the conjugated verb to be (*esti/estas*) + a tense-carrying active participle which is also an adjective. My proposal is to introduce a new verb *hi/has* (with the -av- dropped out) in combination with a generic passive participleending in *-it* (with the -n- and the -a dropped out) , irrespective of the transitivity of the verb. Examples: *mi has dormit* (I have slept) - compare with *mi estas dorminta* in the intransitive, and *mi has legit la libro* (I have read the book) - compare with *mi estas leginta la libro* in the transitive.

15. *ferti*

The verb *farti* sounds really awkward in English. Since English is such a prevalent language, the most widely-spoken second language in the world, I propose to replace it with the verb *ferti* (influenced by English to fare - pronounced as /fer/).

16. *huomo*

The noun *homo* has a well-established meaning in many languages, therefore I propose to replace it with the noun *huomo* (influenced by Italian uomo).

16b. *nej/hej*
16c. *Der / Ti ...*
16d. *kvi..*
16e. *na/jo*
16f. *vas/vis*
